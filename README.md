This is my first website as part of The Odin Project, centered around recipes.

As of the first few commits, it's mainly just for basic HTML practice, using 
things like ordered and unordered lists, relative and absolute links, bolded
and italicized text, images, etc. I should be adding more in the future as
the curriculum introduces things like CSS and JavaScript.
